# <===== BASE BOT WA =====>
This simple base for bot WhatsApp with libs Baileys.
This script was created on May 09, 2024.

This script uses a hot reload configuration which makes it easier for users when changes are made while the script is running.

Don't forget before running the base bot, it's a good idea to change the configuration in the config.js file. This base bot supports the plugin or case model. In the config.js file object settings > case: true then the bot uses the case model and vice versa if false then it uses the plugin model.

I hope it's useful for you and help give this script a star. Thank you.
Continued progress on creating button and message list features!

NB: If you do not understand how to use this base bot, please contact the script owner, they will be happy to help.
